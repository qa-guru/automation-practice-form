## Usage

### Installing dependencies
To install dependencies, run the command:
```sh
$ yarn
```

### Running in the development mode
To run the app in the development mode and view it in browser, run the command:
```sh
$ yarn start
```

### Launching the test runner
To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode, run the command:
```sh
$ yarn test
```
Look up the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Building for production
To build the app for production to the `build` folder, run the command:
```sh
$ yarn run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
Look up the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Removing the single build dependency
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
To remove the single build dependency from your project, run the command:
```sh
$ yarn run eject
```
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
